# Will-it-sell
Once finished, this will be a desktop application that allows users to upload images of T-shirt designs and gives them a percentage of how likely their design is to sell, based off bestselling Redbubble designs.

## Files
**data.py** contains all the web-scraping code.
**model.py** is where the CNN for this project will be stored.
**main.py** can be used to run the Tkinter application.
**urls.txt** has the links to each of the images gotten from Redbubble.
**data-mappings.json** contains a JSON object mapping each of the links in **urls.txt** to its sale metrics on Redbubble.

## Usage
To run the Tkinter application:
Run <code>python main.py</code> in the terminal/command line.
